"""Printed-rule suppression: a page border must not swallow the page.

A page border adds a constant ink floor to every row it spans, and once that floor
clears the gap threshold no in-frame row reads as a gap -- the page returns as one
band and is squeezed into the model window.

Measured 2026-08-27 on the reference implementation over twelve real MNEC papers:
nine collapsed to a single band without this, seven of them returning 0-2
characters, and the twelve together went from 3,846 characters to 5,924. Pages
carrying no rules come back byte-identical.

    A synthetic framed page does NOT fuse in this binding, with or without

    is ~2,040 against a threshold of ~4,080, so the gaps stay visible.
    mon_OCR fuses on the same fixture because its `_SMEAR_X = 11` widens each rule
    column by 10px and triples that floor.

    REAL pages do fuse here. Measured 2026-08-27 over the twelve MNEC page-ones
